Weather Normalisation Technique in R Program
The objective of this research is to exclude impact of meteorology variables by applying a meteorological normalisation technique based on random forest, a machine learning algorithm, to further detect human-factor impact on air quality.
This is done to gain understanding of what physical and chemical processes are driving ambient pollutant concentrations and highlight the suitability and potential use of the technique to justify effectiveness of regulations. 
To be specified, this research dedicates to 
1.	Develop the normalisation technique by utilising RF predictive models based on routine meteorology data which is accessible to most data users. Present a trend analysis of the meteorologically normalised time series. 
2.	Detrend the air concentration data by removing weather normalised time series. Compare the normalised air quality data with the real data after lockdown and test the validation of weather normalisation method. Justify the RFâ€™s advantage of being able to interpret the learning processes and explain the trends which are observed.
3.	Extend the normalisation model to different sites in different areas, further investigate the extend of COVID-19 impact in different areas.
